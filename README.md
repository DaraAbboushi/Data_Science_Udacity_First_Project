# Installations:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib

# Project Motivation:
1) What is the most dominant level of job experience in the Data Science career field?
2) What are the top 10 jobs that have been in high demand in the job market?
3) Do level of experience(in jobs) vary in salary and did the salary increase or decrease along the years of 2020-2024 depending on experience level?
